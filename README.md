# Simple Behave Example

Just a simple use case of how the behave could be applied

## How to run it

Set up your virtual environment. In my case, I used `conda`:

```bash
$ conda create -n bdd-python python=3
$ conda activate bdd-python
```

then, install the requirements:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now that you have all the requirements installed, you finally can run:
```
$ behave
```

### Versions
```
behave==1.2.6
Python==3.8.5
```
